<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Write a brief summary of your project<p>
  
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Health authorities commonly recommend eight 8-ounce glasses<p>
<p>A typical adult naturally loses about 2-3 liters of water a day<p>
<p><b>Benefit of drinking water:</b></p>
<p>Lubricates the joints</p>
<p>Forms saliva and mucus</p>
<p>Regulates body temperature</p>
<p>Helps maintain blood pressure</p>
<p>Prevents kidney damage</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Remind people of drinking sufficient water</p>
<p>Remind people of drinking healthy</p>
<p>Remind people if the water is ready to drink with appropriate</p>

<h2>For Progress Report</h2>
<h3>Current Progress</h3>
<p>Summarize whay you have done so far</p>
<p><b>Highlights:</b></p> 
<p>In particular,articulate thing(s) you have learned/solved outside of what was taught in class</p>

<h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
<p>• How to connect another sensor to Raspberry Pi? Using the same ADC or another one?</p>
<p>• Current experiments show the lighting sensor can differentiate cola and water with same ambient light level. However, ambient light can be a main noise that cannot be ignored in future experiments. How to eliminate the impact of ambient lighting?</p>
<p>• The measurement of temperature delays, which cannot indicate the real-time temperature of water in the glass.</p>

<h3>Future Plan</h3>
<p>• Connect the weight sensor to Raspberry Pi and obtain its measurement</p>
<p>• Appropriately configure all sensors in a container</p>
<p>• Conduct more experiments to figure out how to differentiate types of several common drinks, such as cola, orange juice, and coffee</p>
<p>• Solve the temperature measurement delay problem (by adding a light source and blocking the ambient light)</p>
<p>• Figure out the ways to remind people</p>
<p>• Complete all codes</p>
<p>• Test</p>
<p>• Connect all sensors to OpenChirp (if time allows)</p>
